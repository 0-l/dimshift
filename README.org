* Installation

  1. Clone this repo into a directory of your choice: ~git clone https://github.com/0-l/dimshift && cd dimshift~
  2. Run ~sudo sh install.sh~

* Usage

  1. Call ~dimshift~
  2. Use the keybindings to increase/decrease the intensity: =h= (decrease), =l= (increase)
  3. =q= to quit

  Alternatively, for /i3/ users we can bind =mod + t=, for instance, to spawn dimshift:

  ~bindsym $mod + t exec urxvt -name float -e dimshift~

  Obs: replace =urxvt= with your terminal emulator of choice.

* Uninstalling

  Simply run ~sudo sh uninstall.sh~ to uninstall dimshift.
